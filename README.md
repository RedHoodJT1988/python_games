# Python Games
This is a repo of several different games I have 
made with the Python programming language. I am constantly
adding games to this list. Some are basic games
that are just played on the terminal others have
actual graphics which open in a window. 

## Steps for playing the games
1. Make sure you install Python
   1. You can install Python from www.python.org
2. Clone or download the repo via zip
3. If via zip folder make sure you open a terminal and navigate to where you downloaded the zip file. From there navigate
into the game folder and run ```python3 'name_of_file.py'``` do not add the quotes
4. If via cloning, navigate to a directory you would like to clone the repo to
then change directories to that location in your terminal
5. change into the game directory you want to play
6. run ```python3 'name_of_game.py'``` without the quotes replacing 'name_of_game' with the actual name of the file.
